      "message": "She reported that approximately 7 weeks before admission she first noted a mild sore throat, which persisted despite rest and fluids and did not improve with azithromycin. Over the next days the pain worsened, interfering with sleep, and she developed right-sided throat swelling and a sensation of food sticking when swallowing. Thirty-one days before admission, drainage yielded only sanguineous fluid without purulence. Despite amoxicillin–clavulanate, symptoms waxed and waned; 2 weeks before admission pain and swelling decreased, but 8 days before admission she noted a “froggy” voice and intermittent bleeding. Four days before admission, aspiration yielded dark blood. On the morning of admission, she awoke with increased pain and swelling, felt a “pop,” and noted active bleeding, prompting evaluation."
